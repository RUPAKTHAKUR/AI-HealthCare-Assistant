# 🏥 AI Healthcare Assistant Using RAG and Generative AI

An AI-powered Healthcare Assistant built with React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and Google Gemini API. The application allows users to chat about symptoms, upload medical reports (X-rays, blood reports, lab reports), and receive simplified educational explanations in natural language.

This project uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** principles by combining uploaded medical report content and user queries with a specialized healthcare prompt to generate contextual and relevant responses.

# 🧠 What is RAG in This Project?

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is a technique where relevant external information is provided to the AI model before generating a response.

In this project:

1. User enters symptoms or uploads a medical report.
2. The report/image acts as retrieved context.
3. A specialized healthcare prompt is combined with the user question.
4. Gemini AI generates a contextual response based on both the prompt and the uploaded data.

### RAG Flow

User Query + Uploaded Medical Report + Healthcare Prompt → Gemini AI → Context-Aware Medical Explanation
